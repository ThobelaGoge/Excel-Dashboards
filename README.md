These are just some of the dashboards that I have created.
# Billionaires Dashboard Ranking 2025 (The story behind it, below)
The wealth held by top 1% is always controversial. I came across some data set for early 2025. 
✅When looking at the 2025 data, you have an average billionaire net worth of $14,8Bn. The are two salient outliers being Elon and Bernard who had more than twice the wealth of the 3rd ranked billionaire.
✅The average age was 67. The average age for each gender is close, with males on 68 and females on 65. \\
✅While the number of billionaires is 475 in this set, only 68 are females. However, their average worth ($13.1Bn) is very close to the overall average.

It also worth noticing that the wealth is "overly" skewed towards the top of the top billionaires even at the very top. What's most striking is that, looking at the picture today, in just about a year or so, Elons wealth has more than quadrupled, from $180Bn to $857Bn as per Forbes ranking.

Technology leads the pack, but it begs the question that is it not really a bubble waiting to burst? But what is most sad about this, we see massive layoffs in the same industry which benefits the elites, unimaginably.
